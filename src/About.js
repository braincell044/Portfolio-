          I'm a results-driven Full-Stack Developer with a passion for building high-performance, scalable web applications that drive business growth ðŸš€. Leveraging modern technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and AWS, I've successfully delivered over 30+ production-grade websites for startups, businesses, and investors ðŸ’¼. Whether you're launching a new product or optimizing an existing one, Iâ€™m here to help bring your vision to life! ðŸ’¡
          <br/><br/>
My journey in web development began in 2023, fueled by independent learning on platforms like SoloLearn, Khan Academy, and W3Schools. I later honed my expertise through formal training at Pluralcode Academy, specializing in software development and DevOps on AWS. Over time, Iâ€™ve built a strong foundation in Next.js, React, Bootstrap, CSS, and Node.js, allowing me to create seamless, scalable, and efficient digital solutions.
<br/><br/>
Beyond development, I thrive on solving complex problems, optimizing system performance, and ensuring smooth user interactions. I take a detail-oriented and innovative approach to every project, ensuring that the end product not only meets but exceeds expectations.
<br/><br/>
When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll likely find me exploring and learning new technologies or latest tech trends, engaging with developer communities, or playing online coding games. Letâ€™s connect and build something impactful together! ðŸš€
